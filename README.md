🎓 Computer Engineering Undergrad @ Concordia University (3rd Year)

## About me  
💡 Aspiring **Firmware & Embedded Systems Engineer** with a strong interest in the intersection of hardware and software. I enjoy working at both the **low-level** (firmware, microcontrollers, hardware design) and **high-level** (software integration, system optimization), always aiming to make systems efficient and reliable.  

🔧 I’ve gained experience through both academic and personal projects, which has fueled my curiosity for how things work under the hood and how they can be improved. I always welcome learning new technologies, refining my skills, and contributing to innovative solutions. There are many ways to do one thing but I like to find the best one.
